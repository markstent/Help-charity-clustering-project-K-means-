# HELP - Clustering with K-Means

This was a Kaggle competition for HELP organisation to make suggestions for how to distribute charity funding based on socio-economic factors.
## Technologies/Libraries used

- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- SKlearn
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- K-Means
- Plotly
- Yellowbrick (For silhouette scores and elbow graphs)
## The Results

Using K-means and Plotly choropleth graphs, I was able to group countries into different clusters.

Based on aniterative process and analysis, **Central African Republic** probably needs the most help as its child mortality is high, its net income per person is low, and its life expectancy is low. The 10 million could be used to solve some of these problems.

Next in line would be **Haiti**, **Congo** or **Sierra Leone**

The Jupyter notebook can be found [here](/'HELP_Clustering.ipynb').

The PCA Exploration can be found [here](/Help_PCA.ipynb).

The dataset can be found [here](/Country-data.csv) and the data dictionary [here](/data-dictionary.csv).

## Lessons Learned

This was the first time I have used Plotly and the Yellowbrick library. I toyed around with PCA on this too, but it  wasnt very useful in this case.

I also got to know some of the deeper parameters in Seaborn to improve my visualisations
